## Project Overview

The Celebration Fireworks simulation was built with the following goals:

- **Realistic Fireworks Display:** Using advanced particle systems to create dynamic, colorful explosions.
- **Procedurally Generated Environment:** Including trees and other natural elements to give depth and enhance realism.
- **Dynamic Lighting and Shading:** Utilizing shading techniques to accurately reflect light and color changes within a nighttime setting.
- **Interactive Camera System:** Allows users to view the fireworks from various angles, creating an immersive experience.

## Special Features

The following features were implemented to bring this project to life:

- **Advanced Particle System:** Each firework is composed of numerous particles, simulating real-world behaviors such as gravity, drag, and dispersal.
- **Procedural Tree Generation:** Trees are generated across the environment using fractal algorithms, ensuring each tree appears unique.
- **Dynamic Shading:** Incorporates lighting adjustments based on explosion intensity, enhancing the realism of each burst.
- **Interactive Camera Controls:** The user can navigate the environment and adjust the view, enhancing the interactivity of the simulation.

## Technical Challenges

Building Celebration Fireworks presented a range of challenges:

- **Particle Optimization:** Ensuring smooth performance while rendering hundreds of particles per firework required extensive fine-tuning.
- **Natural Tree Generation:** Procedural algorithms had to balance realism with efficiency, ensuring that each tree appeared lifelike without performance degradation.
- **Dynamic Lighting Effects:** Dynamic reflection and shading effects were partially implemented; however, their complexity posed significant challenges.

Despite these obstacles, the project represents a successful integration of advanced graphics and real-time environmental interaction.
